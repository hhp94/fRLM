# Random Effects fRLM

We extend the fRLM model to account for random effects. Denoting the state index by $\sigma$ and the state individual $i$ was in at time $t$ by $\sigma_{it}$, the random-effect fRLM model is:


$$
y_i = \boldsymbol C_i^\prime\boldsymbol\alpha  + \sum_{j=1}^k\delta_j \int_{a}^{b} X_{ij}(t)\omega_j(t)dt + \sum_{t=1}^T\sum_{\sigma=1}^S1\{\sigma_{it} =\sigma\}\rho^{T-t}\xi_{\sigma} + \epsilon_i,
$$

$$
\xi_\sigma \sim N(0,\sigma_{\xi}^2),
$$
$$
\epsilon_i\sim N(0, \sigma_\epsilon^2)
$$

where $\boldsymbol C_i$ is a vector of covariates including an intercept, $X_{ij}(t)$ is the  exposure $j$ for individual $i$ expressed as a function of time, with associated weight $w_j$. For instance, $j$ may be "tobacco tax". $1\{A\}$ is the indicator function ant takes value $1$ if $A$ is true and $0$ otherwise, $\rho\in(0,1)$ is a discount factor and $\xi_\sigma$ is the state random effect, which, for simplicity is assumed constant over time (but varies across states). The state random-effects account for unmeasured state-effects and accumulate over time for a given respondent $i$. Furthermore, we assume that all $\xi_\sigma, \epsilon_i$ are mutually independent for all $\sigma$ and $i$.



## Model Overview
The presented model is a Random Effects functional relevant life course model (REfRLM) - which means it's a type of regression model where the dependent variable $y_i$ is influenced by both fixed and random effects. The "functional" aspect refers to the integration over a function of time, $X_{ij}(t)$.

## Model Components

### 1. **Dependent Variable**
$$y_i$$
This represents the outcome or response variable for individual $i$.

### 2. **Fixed Effects**

$$\boldsymbol C_i^\prime\boldsymbol\alpha$$

Here, $\boldsymbol C_i$ is a vector of covariates (or predictors) for individual $i$. The 'prime' notation indicates that it's transposed (which typically means it's a row vector). $\boldsymbol\alpha$ is the vector of coefficients corresponding to these covariates. The product of these two vectors gives us the linear combination of the predictors.

### 3. **Functional Component**

$$\sum_{j=1}^k\delta_j \int_{a}^{b} X_{ij}(t)\omega_j(t)dt$$

This component captures the effect of time-dependent exposures on the dependent variable. The exposure $X_{ij}(t)$ is a function of time $t$ for individual $i$ and exposure type $j$. For example, $j$ could represent different exposures like "tobacco tax" over time. $\omega_j(t)$ is the associated weight or coefficient for this exposure type at time $t$, and $\delta_j$ is an overall scaling factor for this exposure type. The integration from $a$ to $b$ gives the accumulated effect of this exposure over the time interval [a, b].

### 4. **Random Effect Component**

$$\sum_{t=1}^T\sum_{\sigma=1}^S1\{\sigma_{it} =\sigma\}\rho^{T-t}\xi_{\sigma}$$

This part of the model captures the state-specific random effects, which can be thought of as deviations from the overall mean effect that are specific to different states (or groups). 

- $\sigma_{it}$ represents the state that individual $i$ was in at time $t$.
  
- $\xi_{\sigma}$ is the random effect for state $\sigma$, and its distribution is assumed to be normal with mean 0 and variance $\sigma_{\xi}^2$.

- $\rho^{T-t}$ is a discounting factor. It gives less weight to the state effects the further they are in the past. $\rho$ is between 0 and 1.

### 5. **Error Term**

$$\epsilon_i$$

This captures the random errors or residuals for individual $i$. They're assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and variance $\sigma_\epsilon^2$.

### 6. **Indicator Function**

$$1\{A\}$$

The notation $1\{A\}$ is an indicator function. It takes on the value 1 when the condition inside the curly braces is true and 0 otherwise.

## Interpretation

- The outcome $y_i$ for each individual is modeled as a combination of their covariates, the accumulated effect of time-dependent exposures, and state-specific random effects.

- The functional component allows for capturing intricate time-dependent patterns of different exposures, like how a "tobacco tax" might impact an individual over time.

- The random effect part accommodates unmeasured state-specific factors. By allowing these effects to accumulate over time with a discount factor, the model captures the diminishing importance of states the individual was in the distant past.

- The model assumes that the random effects and the error terms are mutually independent, which means there's no correlation between them for any given state or individual.

In summary, this is a sophisticated regression model that captures both fixed effects (like individual covariates and time-dependent exposures) and random effects (state-specific deviations), allowing for a deep understanding of the data's underlying structure and potential influences on the dependent variable.
